# ES6-and-Bulma-CSS
Random fun with ES6 and CSS framework, Bulma.

### ES6
Testing all the new features and writing plenty of comments <3

### Bulma
Bulma is a free and open source CSS framework based on Flexbox. There is no JavaScript included, and can be considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of the logic.
